                <strong style="font-size: 1.8rem;">Patna</strong> stretches along the southern bank of
                the Ganges for about 15 km. The 5.7 km - long Mahatma Gandhi Setu, one of the longest river bridges in
                the world, connects Patna with northern Bihar.
            </h5>
            <h5>Patna, located just east of the river’s confluence with three major tributaries, was once a powerful
                city. Early in the 5th century BC, Ajatasatru shifted the capital of his Magadha kingdom from Rajgir to
                Pataliputra (Patna), fulfilling Buddha’s prophecy that a great city would arise here.
                EmperorsChandragupta Maurya and Ashoka also called Pataliputra home, and it remained one of India’s most
                important cities for almost 1000 years </h5>

                <p>It is Patna’s latest iconic 34m-high sandstone arch - <em>Sabhyata Dwar </em>- on the bank of river
                    Ganga, built with a Mauryan architecture to evoke the glory of the ancient capital of Pataliputra
                    that serves as the ceremonial gateway to the city. It stands on the sprawling premises of the Samrat
                    Ashoka International Convention Centre, which neighbours the Patna’s Gandhi Maidan.
                </p>
                <p>The ceremonial arch was originally envisioned by late ex-Vice Army Chief Lt Gen (retd) S K Sinha as
                    the ‘civilisation gate’ that would beckon travellers and passersby to Patna and draw them to its
                    rich and multi-layered history, as it did in the reign of the Mauryan Empire over 2,500 years ago.
                </p>
                <p>The inscriptions will be attributed to Megasthenes, the ancient Greek envoy to Pataliputra – the
                    capital of the Mauryan Empire; to King Ashoka, who ruled ancient India from his capital in
                    Pataliputra (today’s Patna); to Lord Buddha and to Lord Mahavira

                    The library finds its origin in private collection of a bibliophile Mohammad Bakhsh and expanded by
                    his son Khuda Bakhsh, who inherited 1,400 manuscripts and continued to add to the collection and
                    eventually converted it into a private library by 1880. The library was opened to public upon its
                    inauguration by Sir Charles Alfred Elliott, Governor of Bengal on 5 October 1891. After partition in
                    1947, Dr. S.V. Sohoni played a key role in ensuring that the collections were retained in India.[5]
                    In 1969 through a Federal Legislation, an Act of Parliament, namely 'Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Public
                    Library Act' (1969), the Government of India declared Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Public Library a centre
                    of national importance and government took over the funding, maintenance and development of the
                    library. Today it continues to attract scholars from all over the world.

                    Years after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi in 1948, an appeal was made to the citizens of India
                    nationwide to build memorials for Gandhi. With the help of contributions of poor and rich citizens
                    of India, a trust was established with the name Mahatma Gandhi National Memorial Trust, for this
                    cause.[3][4] The Patna Sangrahalaya was established in 1967[5] near the North-Western corner of
                    Gandhi Maidan. It was a member of the Central Gandhi Sangrahalaya Samiti until July 1971, when the
                    five museums (Ahmadabad, Madurai, Bairakpore, Mumbai, Patna) were made independent.

                    Patan Devi, also called Maa Patneshwari is the oldest and one of the most sacred temples of Patna.
                    It is regarded as one of the 51 Siddha Shakti Pithas in India. According to Puranic legends, the
                    'right thigh' of the corpse of Sati had fallen here when it was chopped off by Lord Vishnu with his
                    'Sudarshan Chakra'. The ancient temple, originally called Maa Sarvanand Kari Patneshwari, is
                    believed to be the abode of the goddess Durga. The name of the city Patna is widely believed to have
                    been derived from the name of the Bari Patan Devi Temple (located nearby Patna Saheb Gurudwara).
                    Some, however, doubt whether the name of Patna is derived from this temple. According to them, the
                    name is derived from Patan, which means a town and Patna was a big place of export and import.

            <h5>AIR</h5>
            <br />
            Patna’s Jaiprakash Narayan International Airport is 8km from the city centre. Between them, Air India
            (0612-2223199; www.airindia.in; Patna airport), IndiGo (1800 1803838; www. goindigo.in; Patna airport) and
            JetKonnect (www.jetkonnect.com; Patna airport) fly daily to Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata. The IndiGo
            flight to Mumbai goes via Lucknow.</p>
            <p>
            <h5>BUS</h5>
            The main bus stand occupies a large, dusty space about 1.5km from the train station (Rs.5 shared autos run
            here from the back of the train station). It is a hugely hectic place, but if you walk into the chaos
            telling people where you want to go, you will soon get shown to the right bus; buy tickets on board. There
            are frequent services throughout the day, and some sleeper buses to Ranchi and</p>
            <ul class="isting">
                <li>Raxaul. Destinations include: Gaya Rs.100, three hours</li>
                <li>Kesariya Rs.100, three hours</li>
                <li>Motihari Rs.145, 4 1⁄2 hours</li>

                <li>Vaishali Rs. 60, two hours</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            <h5>CAR</h5>
            <br />
            Hiring a car and driver can be done through Thomas Cook (p525), starting from Rs. 10 per kilo-metre (minimum
            200km) plus a driver allowance of Rs.300 per overnight stay.</p>
            <p>
            <h5>TRAIN</h5>
            <br />
            <p>
                Patna Junction has a foreign-tourist ticket counter (window 3, Patna Junction; Time: 8am-8pm; Days:
                Mon-Sat, to 2pm Sun) at the 1st-floor reservation office, in the right-hand wing of the station. Trains
                leave roughly hourly for Gaya (2nd class/AC chair Rs.25/290, two to three hours) between 5am and
                11.30pm. Just buy a 2nd-class ‘general’ ticket and hop on the next available service.
            <p>
            <p>More than a dozen daily trains leave for New Delhi (sleeper/3AC/2AC Rs.500/1260/1825, 12 to 18 hours);
                the quickest and most convenient time-wise, is the RJPB Rajdhani (3AC/2AC/1AC Rs. 610/2235/3730) which
                leaves at 7.25pm and arrives in Delhi at 7.40am.
            </p>
            <p>Ten daily trains go to Kolkata (sleeper/ 3AC/2AC Rs.340/880/1240, eight to 14 hours). The best time-wise
                is probably the Vibhuti Express (10.35pm, nine hours).
            </p>
            <p>At least 20 daily trains go to Varanasi (sleeper/3AC/2AC Rs.160/485/690, four to six hours) between 5am
                and 11pm.
            </p>
            <p>Three fast trains go to Ranchi (sleeper/ 3AC/2AC Rs.310/835/1195, eight to 10 hours), leaving at 6am,
                11.40am and 9.45pm.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h5>Getting Around</h5>
            <br />
            <ul class="listing">
                <li>The airport is located 7km west of the city centre. Autorickshaws/taxis cost Rs.150/350 from the
                    prepaid stand by the train station.
                </li>
                <li>Shared autos (often jam-packed) depart from the rear of the train station. They shuttle between the
                    train station and Gandhi Maidan (Rs. 5), and between the train station and the bus stand (also Rs.
                    5).
